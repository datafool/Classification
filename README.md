This repository contains the code developed for classification course of ML specilization of Coursera. 
iPython Notebook has been developed to use open source ML library like-
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Sci-kit learn

However, lot of effort has been put into creating most of the algorithms from scrap by just using Pandas and Numpy. Reason for using Pandas and Numpy is that they help in creating very effective implementation of Linear Algebra which makes implementing most of the algorithm easy

This notebooks can be used freely
